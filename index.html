          <p>Phillip Schofield sends shock waves through the country with his latest scandal.</p>
			<p>I’M A CELEBRITY…GET ME OUT OF HERE! is just days away from it’s launch now that the 2019 celebrity line-up has been revealed. But Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby suggested there will be a secret contestant dropping in to the jungle soon.</p>
			<p>I’m A Celeb fans will not have to wait too long for the 19th series which will see campmates compete to be crowned the queen or King of the jungle this year.

This even got This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip talking about this years interesting line-up. 

The pair got talking about the surprise contestant who usually pops up after the first few weeks of the show. 

Holly, who replaced Ant Mcpartlin last year, shared her insight: “The surprise one comes in and sort of shifts things around, stirs things around because we had Noel Edmonds come in last year:”</p>
		<p>Excited by the show, Phillip shared his thoughts on who he would love to see appear as the guest contestant. 

“Do you know who I would like to go in?” he asked Holly. 

The TV host replied: “I know who you are going to say.”

Before going any further, Phillip quickly told viewers that “it’s never released and you just don’t know but my guess if I was to have my favourite, Richard Madeley.”</p>
		<p>This year's line-up are an interesting group consisting of soap stars, reality TV stars, singers and singers and sportsmen. 

Some of the famous faces include Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright, Nadine Coyle and Kate Garraway. 

This is believed to feature some of the highest-paid stars so far.

Last year’s winner Harry Redknapp earned a whopping £500,000 for appearing on the show but will any of the stars receive something similar? </p>
